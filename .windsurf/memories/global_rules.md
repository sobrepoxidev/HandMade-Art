Framework is Next.js (App Router).

Use Supabase as the sole database / auth layer.

Produce readable, briefly commented code—no cryptic tricks.

Ensure every solution is optimized for performance and bundle size.

Apply security best practices (no client-side secrets, thorough input validation, avoid dangerous APIs).

Understand the task first and pick the simplest adequate design (simple ≠ simplistic).

Research existing open-source patterns; adopt them only if they fit seamlessly—otherwise skip.

Prefer built-in Next.js features whenever possible: next/navigation, <Link>, <Image>, Server Components by default, "use client" only when needed.

No dead code—never leave unused imports, variables, props, or components.

Always declare explicit types; zero implicit any is allowed.
